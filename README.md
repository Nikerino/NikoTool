My personal organizer application

## About
This application is to keep myself organized and productive. I previously used a pen and paper planner and thought to myself how much easier it would be if I had a software for this. There are plenty of applications like this out there, but I thought it'd be fun to make one on my own, so here it is.

The goal for this project was to keep it simple and minimilistic. I've been trying to make a project like this for a while, but everytime I drew something up, it was too complicated. I was getting caught up in the cool features I could make it have but on this one am really going for a simplistic, easy to use but useful feeling.

## Status
- I just finished the lists feature for this project and while I'm still swamped with schoolwork, I'm at least more organized with it. Only a month left in this semester and I'll have a lot of free time this winter to work on this project more. 

## Current Features
- Lists
  - I figured this feature needed to be implemented first as it's probably the most useful to my productivity. 
  - This allows for lists to be created by the User, each storing their own set of tasks
  - A list is comprised of a name and a set of its tasks, while a task is comprised of just a name, to allow for flexibility in describing what the task is comprised of without making things overcomplicated for viewing or working with
    - eg. a due date, important notes, etc.
    
## Upcoming Features
- Schedule / Calendar
  - This idea is inspired by the calendar/schedule design services like outlook and apple calendars implement. The idea of adding events and viewing their time slots visually on a schedule seems very cool and useful to me.
- Project Tracker
  - This will be useful for personal projects I'm working on ( mostly CS projects ). This is inspired by Github's project tab, as I've found a lot of success in using it for working with small teams on projects. 
- Mobile Version / Syncing
  - Eventually I want to develop a mobile version of this application so that I can preform todo-list / schedule related tasks on my phone and see those changes on my desktop and laptop since I use all three devices throughout the day.

## Made Using
- HTML / CSS / JS
This is the bulk of the project, using HTML and CSS to make this look nice and JS to add the funcitonality necessary.

- NodeJS / Electron
Electron is the main framework being used for this project. I wanted to make this a desktop application rather than a website, just because I like the look better. Electron also runs on the NodeJS runtime, so I have that installed as well.
