# NikoTool
My personal organizer application.

## Made Using
- HTML / CSS / JS
-- This is the bulk of the project, using HTML and CSS to make this look nice and JS to add the funcitonality necessary.
- NodeJS / Electron
-- Electron is the main framework being used for this project. I wanted to make this a desktop application rather than a website, just because I like the look better. Electron also runs on the NodeJS runtime, so I have that installed as well.
